# BikeEnvironment
This is a simulation environment for a bicycle and controller created by [Michael Marne](https://github.com/Kalveo) and [Ivar Wikenstedt](https://github.com/Wikenvar). How to use the environment is located currently in `README.txt`

There is a 3D visualization tool that visualizes the simulationdata from the simulinkfile.

The plan is to continue working on a few features in the future, however this is currently not a prioritzed project.

You are free to use this environment and edit it for simulation. If you do use this, please add an acknowledgement to Michael and Ivar in your report!
